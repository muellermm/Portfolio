Starting from the attempt to give it a really quick overhaul over one weekend, now trying to iteratively improve it

Mind you, I am a designer who has recently started working more and more with front-end development. 

Project started based on the Skeleton framework (http://getskeleton.com), and then some really quick customization.

Since this is as much of a learning experience as anything else, please keep this in mind, and feel free to let me know if you discover issues.
